**Title:** Exoplanet Detection with Decision Trees

**Research Question:** How can we use decision trees and machine learning models to assist in the discovery of exoplanets?

Exoplanets are commonly detected through observations of the brightness and movement of the stars they orbit with the radial velocity and transit methods. In the past, machine learning algorithms have successfully been able to classify possible candidates as confirmed exoplanets and false positives. Machine learning algorithms when implemented can efficiently analyze large samples of data and automate the process of detection. In our research, we train a decision tree algorithm on training sets containing confirmed exoplanets and false positives from the Kepler Mission in the NASA Exoplanet Archive. From our research and training, we obtain a decision tree model with a (insert percentage) accuracy at detecting exoplanets. The decision tree algorithm is a viable option in classifying and detecting exoplanets as it showcases its efficacy and ability to do so. Machine learning algorithms here prove to be effective in astronomy and will continue to do so in the future.
