Decision trees are a  machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. In a decision tree, the data is split into branches based on feature values, leading to a tree-like structure where each internal branch node represents a decision based on a feature, and each leaf node represents the final prediction or outcome.

## How Decision Trees Work

1. Tree Construction:
   - Decision trees start with a root node that represents the entire dataset.
   - At each internal node, a feature is selected to split the data based on certain criteria.
   - The data is recursively partitioned into child nodes based on the selected feature, creating branches in the tree.
   - The process continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum tree depth.

2. Decision Rules:
   - Each internal node represents a decision based on a feature. It tests a condition, such as "Is feature X greater than a threshold?" or "Does feature Y belong to a specific category?"
   - The path followed from the root to a leaf node determines the decision rules that classify or predict the outcome.

3. Leaf Node Predictions:
   - Each leaf node represents a final prediction or outcome.
   - For classification, the leaf node can represent a specific class label.
   - For regression, the leaf node can represent a numerical value or an average of the target values in the corresponding subset.

## Advantages and Limitations

- **Advantages**:
  - Decision trees are easy to understand and interpret, providing transparent decision rules.
  - They can handle both categorical and numerical features.
  - Decision trees can capture nonlinear relationships between features and the target variable.

- **Limitations**:
  - Decision trees can be prone to overfitting, especially when the tree becomes too deep and complex.
  - They can be sensitive to small changes in the data, leading to different tree structures.
  - Decision trees may struggle to capture interactions between features if they are not explicitly represented.
  - They can produce biased results when certain features dominate the tree construction process.
