Gradient boosting is a powerful machine learning technique that belongs to the class of ensemble learning methods. It combines multiple weak learners, typically decision trees, to create a strong predictive model. Gradient boosting is known for its ability to handle complex relationships and improve overall performance in both regression and classification.

## How Gradient Boosting Works

1. Weak Learners:
   - Gradient boosting starts with an initial weak learner, often a decision tree, which is trained on the data.
   - The weak learner predicts the target variable, but its predictions are often imperfect.

2. Error Calculation and Update:
   - The algorithm calculates the difference between the actual target values and the predictions made by the weak learner.
   - This difference, known as the residual error or gradient, becomes the target variable for the next weak learner.
   - The subsequent weak learners are trained to predict this residual error, effectively correcting the mistakes made by the previous models.

3. Ensemble Combination:
   - The predictions from all weak learners are combined to form the final prediction.
   - Each weak learner's contribution to the final prediction is weighted based on its performance, typically using a learning rate parameter.

4. Iterative Refinement:
   - The process of adding new weak learners and updating their weights is repeated iteratively until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum number of iterations or achieving a performance threshold.

## Advantages of Gradient Boosting

- **Improved Performance**: Gradient boosting creates a strong predictive model by combining multiple weak learners, resulting in improved accuracy and predictive power compared to individual models.

- **Feature Importance**: Gradient boosting provides a measure of feature importance, allowing you to identify the most influential features for the prediction task.
