### Model Training and Evaluation
Model training involves feeding the algorithm with labeled training data to learn patterns and build a predictive model. Evaluation is performed to assess the performance and generalization capability of the trained model using validation or test data. Various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, can be used to evaluate the model's effectiveness.
