## Machine Learning Algorithms

### [[Decision Trees]]
Decision trees are a widely used algorithm for classification and regression tasks. They construct a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, and each leaf node represents the final prediction or outcome. Decision trees are interpretable, easy to understand, and can handle both categorical and numerical data.

### [[Gradient Boosting]]
Gradient boosting is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple weak learners, typically decision trees, to create a strong predictive model. It works by iteratively training models that correct the mistakes of the previous models, leading to a highly accurate and robust model. Gradient boosting is known for its ability to handle complex relationships and improve overall performance.

### [[Random Forest]]
Random forest is another ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to form a more accurate and stable prediction. It creates an ensemble by training each decision tree on a random subset of the data and using the majority vote or averaging for predictions. Random forest is effective in handling high-dimensional data and mitigating overfitting.
