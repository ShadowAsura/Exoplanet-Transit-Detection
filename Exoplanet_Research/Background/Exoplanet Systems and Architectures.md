Exoplanet systems exhibit a variety of architectures, including:

## [[Single-Planet Systems]]
   - Characteristics: Consist of a star with a single exoplanet.
   - Examples: 51 Pegasi b, HD 189733b.

## [[Multi-Planet Systems]]
   - Characteristics: Consist of a star with multiple exoplanets.
   - Examples: TRAPPIST-1 system, Kepler-90 system.

## [[Circumbinary Planets]]
   - Characteristics: Exoplanets orbiting binary star systems.
   - Examples: Kepler-16b, Kepler-34b.

## [[Resonant Planetary Systems]]
   - Characteristics: Exoplanets with orbits that are in a resonant configuration.
   - Examples: Kepler-223 system, Kepler-80 system.

## [[Hierarchical Planetary Systems]]
   - Characteristics: Exoplanets with well-organized, nested orbits.
   - Examples: Kepler-11 system, Kepler-90 system.

## [[Compact Planetary Systems]]
   - Characteristics: Exoplanets with orbits close to their host star.
   - Examples: TRAPPIST-1 system, Kepler-42 system.
