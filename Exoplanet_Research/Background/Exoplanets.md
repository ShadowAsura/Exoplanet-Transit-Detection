## What are Exoplanets?

Exoplanets, also known as extrasolar planets, are planets located outside our solar system. Their discovery has revolutionized our understanding of planetary systems and opened up new possibilities for finding habitable environments beyond Earth.

## [[Detection Methods]]

Various methods have been employed to detect exoplanets, including the Radial Velocity Method, Transit Method, Direct Imaging, and Gravitational Microlensing. These methods enable astronomers to identify and classify exoplanets based on their size, mass, and orbital properties.

## [[Exoplanet Classifications]]

Exoplanets exhibit a wide range of properties and diversity, including:

1. Gas Giants:
   - Characteristics: Large in size, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium.
   - Examples: Jupiter-like planets, Saturn-like planets.

2. Super-Earths:
   - Characteristics: More massive and larger than Earth, but smaller than gas giants.
   - Examples: Kepler-20b, Gliese 581c.

3. Terrestrial Planets:
   - Characteristics: Similar in size and composition to Earth.
   - Examples: Kepler-186f, Proxima Centauri b.

4. Hot Jupiters:
   - Characteristics: Gas giants with short orbital periods, often close to their host stars.
   - Examples: HD 209458b, WASP-12b.

5. Water Worlds:
   - Characteristics: Exoplanets covered by a deep global ocean.
   - Examples: GJ 1214b, Kepler-62e.

6. Mini-Neptunes:
   - Characteristics: Intermediate between terrestrial planets and gas giants.
   - Examples: Kepler-11b, K2-18b.


## [[Exoplanet Systems and Architectures]]

Exoplanet systems exhibit a variety of architectures, including:

1. Single-Planet Systems:
   - Characteristics: Consist of a star with a single exoplanet.
   - Examples: 51 Pegasi b, HD 189733b.

2. Multi-Planet Systems:
   - Characteristics: Consist of a star with multiple exoplanets.
   - Examples: TRAPPIST-1 system, Kepler-90 system.

3. Circumbinary Planets:
   - Characteristics: Exoplanets orbiting binary star systems.
   - Examples: Kepler-16b, Kepler-34b.

4. Resonant Planetary Systems:
   - Characteristics: Exoplanets with orbits that are in a resonant configuration.
   - Examples: Kepler-223 system, Kepler-80 system.

5. Hierarchical Planetary Systems:
   - Characteristics: Exoplanets with well-organized, nested orbits.
   - Examples: Kepler-11 system, Kepler-90 system.

6. Compact Planetary Systems:
   - Characteristics: Exoplanets with orbits close to their host star.
   - Examples: TRAPPIST-1 system, Kepler-42 system.
